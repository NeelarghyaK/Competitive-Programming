**Albert** and **Bernard** just became friends with **Cheryl**, and they want to know **when her birthday is**. **Cheryl** gives them a list of 10 possible dates:

**May 15, May 16, May 19
June 17, June 18
July 14, July 16
August 14, August 15, August 17**<br><br>
**Cheryl** then tells **Albert** and **Bernard** separately the **month** and the **day** of her birthday respectively.

**Albert**: I don't know when Cheryl's birthday is, but I know that Bernard doesn't know too.<br>
**Bernard**: At first I did not know when Cheryl's birthday is, but I know now.<br>
**Albert**: Then I also know when Cheryl's birthday is.<br><br>
**So when is Cheryl's birthday?**
