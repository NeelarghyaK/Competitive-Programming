There are **5 baskets**. **Each basket has 2 balls**. **4** of those baskets has **identical balls each of weight 5 kg** (all 8 of those balls are identical). 
The remaining **1 basket has 2 balls that weight 10kg each.**<br>
You are given a weighing scale that gives you the value of weight in the left pan minus the value of weight in the  right pan. **(Output=Left pan-Right Pan)**
<br>
What is the **minimum number of weighing** you need to do before you can identify the unique basket? <br>
(Clarification: You would be able to read the measurement of the weighing scale only after you have placed certain number of balls on both the pans and pressed a confirm button. This counts as a weighing.) 

Stuck? Try the Unique Ball problem first. :)
